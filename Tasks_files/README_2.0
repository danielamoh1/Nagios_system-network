1. **Set Up Network Interfaces:**
Open /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml and find the section af-packet:. Here, specify the network interface you want Suricata to monitor.

2. **Specify Rule Files:**
In the same suricata.yaml file, locate the rule-files: section and include your desired rule files. You can use community-sourced rules like Emerging Threats or your custom rules.

3. **Custom Rules:**
If creating custom rules, add them to /etc/suricata/rules/ directory. Example of a custom rule file custom.rules:
```
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Possible HTTP traffic detected"; sid:1000001;)
```
